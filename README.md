# Linux Kernel Module Project

## Overview

This project is a Linux kernel module designed to implement a simple character device driver that supports 32-bit read and write operations. The module allows user-space applications to interact with the kernel driver by reading and writing 32-bit data.

## Features

- Supports 32-bit read and write operations.
- A character device driver for interaction with user-space applications.
- Properly handles file positions and data transfers.
